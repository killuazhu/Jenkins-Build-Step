<div>Define files to publish through a list of file filters. Each filter is separated by a new line. To specify the component for a filter, append an equals sign and component to the filter (e.g. example-file.xml=example-component). If a component is not specified, the filter will apply to all components. Default is **/* which includes everything in the workspace.</div>
