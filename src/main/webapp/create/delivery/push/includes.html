<div>
    Define files to publish through a list of file filters.
    Each filter is separated by a new line.
    To specify the component for a filter, append an equals sign and component to the filter (e.g. example-file.xml=example-component).
    If a component is not specified, the filter will apply to all components.
    Default is **/* which includes everything in the workspace.
